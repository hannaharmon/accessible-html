<h1>Why Accessibility?</h1>
<p>There are different users of different abilities and backgrounds. To make webpages accessible for all kinds of users is essential.</p>
<h1>How Accessibility?</h1>
<p>A good rule of thumb for accessible web pages is to follow POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust):</p>
  <li>Perceivable: Information and user interface must be presentable in ways users can perceive (e.g., text alternatives for images, captions for audio).</li>
  <li>Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable (e.g., keyboard accessibility, sufficient time for interactions).</li>
  <li>Understandable: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable (e.g., clear language, predictable navigation, error prevention).</li>
  <li>Robust: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies (e.g., HTML standards, browser compatibility)</li>
<p>For example, these images</p>
